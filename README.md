# HISTORY OF INDIAN SPACE MISSIONS

Introduction: This is an analysis on Indian Space Missions since 1975. 
Names of the spacecrafts along with their orbit type and application are visualised. 
This is an interactive story where users can click on a mission to view its application, 
orbit type, launch vehicle type and whether a mission has succesfully launched or failed. 
This story provides a detailed overview of ISRO's role in space exploration and deployment
of satellites.

Data/operation abstraction design: The data used is downloaded from kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anoopjohny/isro-dataset
This dataset contained very few null values and was easy to work with.

Future work:
I intend to include the financial aspects of every satellite ever launched by ISRO to 
highlight the organization's significant achievements despite limited resources. This data 
will provide insights into the challenges that may have contributed to the delayed start
of the progress of India's space exploration initiatives.
